It also offers VPN services, but our earlier setup didn't include it.  In many services, you can simply add a function or additional configuration. In others, like RRAS, you can't. We have to delete the configuration and start again. This isn't as daunting as it sounds! You aren't uninstalling the Server Feature; this is just reconfiguration within the RRAS tool.  Let's begin.  Open the Routing and Remote Access window. (Server Manager application -&gt; Tools -&gt; Routing and Remote Access)Find your local server in the column list on the left (likely SRV1-SENECAUSERNAME (local)).Right-click it and select Disable Routing and Remote Access.

Remember in our DHCP lab where we specified that the DHCP could only use 10.0.UID.2-10.0.UID.199, even though we could have gone up to .254? That wasn't arbitrary!

Each connection must have its own unshared port. These are recycled after disconnect.  In production environments, decisions have to be made from a business perspective at this point. How many people do we expect to be logging in to the VPN at any given time? We need to have enough ports available for that number, otherwise ports will run out and additional people won't be able to connect.  For us, we're going to stick with a demo number of 10 ports. That means we will support 10 simultaneous active VPN client connections. (If an 11th person tried to connect when 10 others were online, they'd get a connection error.)

When security is only considered at the end of a project, it's very difficult to remember all the ways in which your product interacts and things can get missed.  This created several high-profile breaches in the 90s and early 2000s, and our approach to security had to be reconsidered.  As a result, we now consider security from the beginning. As you create applications, add users to databases, create links between services, you must keep security in mind at every step of development. Securing as you go is the best method, but even something as simple as simply documenting unsecured parts of your code as you go can be enough (assuming you go back and fix them!)  Generally, we apply the concept of Principle of Least Privilege to security. Essentially, this boils down to locking everything down as much as possible and only allowing what and who you need through. Open access makes you a target. You'll be applying this principle to the firewall later in this lab.  We also take a look at defaults. Most systems and software come with pre-configured defaults to make out-of-the-box setup easy. This can take the form of a default username and password, default ports, etc. In a well secured system, these are often changed to avoid hack attempts. If you know the default, there's a high chance that hackers know it as well. You'll be changing some defaults in this lab.  This is not an exhaustive list of applied security, but it does give us a bit of working knowledge. You'll need it for this lab as well as in our later work.

Any application, service, or other data that is sent or received by your computer goes through your firewall first. The dominant network protocol is TCP/IP, which means we’re dealing with packets.  A firewall looks at these packets.  To be clear, the firewall doesn’t look inside packets, but just at the outside data like IP address and/or port destination, etc. The actual transmitted data is still secure and unread.  Generally with firewalls, we apply the Principle of Least Privilege by dropping all new connections by default, and allowing a few exceptions. This is known as whitelisting.

Although programmers and developers usually use graphical IDE's to code and compile programs (Visual Studio, Sublime, Eclipse, etc), they can create source code using a text editor and compile their code directly on the server to generate executable programs (without having to transfer them for compilation or execution).  Developers very often use a text editor to modify configuration files. In this course, you will become familiar with the process of installing, configuring, and running network services. Text editors are an important tool to help this setup, but are also used to &quot;tweak&quot; or make periodic changes in service configurations.  The most readily-available command line text editor built into Windows is Notepad.  However, Notepad is not available in Server Core. To edit a text file in that environment, we have three main options:  Use PowerShell's object-oriented programming to send an edit directly into a text file. This is cumbersome and is not interactive (you don't see the text file on screen), but it is the only built-in option.Transferring the file to a different computer that does have a text editor (like your Windows 11 client), modifying the file there, and transferring it back to your Server Core machine.Using Visual Studio Code to connect remotely the environment. This is by far the coolest and most convenient option.  We'll be doing all three in this lab to show you how, but going forward, VS Code will be our go-to for interacting with Server Core in most instances.

At the moment, the server's firewall is configured using defaults. As mentioned above, defaults are a security risk as they are known to everyone and can be used against you. If an attacker doesn't know your configuration, it's harder for them to know what's open and what's not and how to attack.  As you saw from Part 2, ping between client1 and srv1 didn't work.  By default, the ability to ping a server is turned off. A ping (a type of ICMP packet) is typically used to see if you can get a response from a server. Having a server respond let's an attacker know there's a machine there that they can then try to break into.  Imagine a burglar knocks on a random brick wall (sends a ping). If you (the server) knock back (send a ping reply), the burglar now knows there's a person there who probably has some nice stuff! Don't knock back, and the burglar has no idea what's on the other side of that wall and will move on.  We want to turn on ping so we can test connections between our machines, but we have to be careful. Turning that on through the firewall too broadly opens us up to that vulnerability.  We are going to turn it on only for our local network. Our VMs will be allowed to ping each other, but anything outside of our subnet (10.0.UID.0/24) can't. Best of both worlds.  To do this, we're going to work with the Windows Defender Firewall on srv1.  In the Server Manager application, go to Local Server.In the Properties section of this page, look for the Microsoft Defender Firewall line item.Next to the line, it should say Public: On. Click on this.The Windows Security &gt; Firewall &amp; Network protection application opens.On this screen, you will see three networks: Domain network, Private network, and Public network.We'll spend more time with these in later weeks, but for now, all three should say: Firewall is on.Below this, click on the link that says: Advanced settingsThis opens the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security application.On the first page, you'll notice the same three profiles: Domain Profile, Private Profile, and Public Profile.All three have the same overall rules:Windows Defender Firewall is on: This just confirms the firewall is active for this network profile.Inbound connections that do not match a rule are blocked: This means that all incoming connections and requests (like trying to ping this machine) are blocked by default. If you want to allow a certain type of connection or service into your server, you have to make a specific rule for it. This is whitelisting and our Principle of Least Privilege in action.Outbound connections that do not match a rule are allowed: This means all network data leaving the server is automatically allowed. The logic here is that if the server is the one deciding the send out information, it's likely fine. (Note: The only time we ever whitelist outbound connections is for specialized security settings like government compliance.)At the moment, we're dealing with the Public Profile context. Let's allow ICMP ping!On the left-hand menu bar, click Inbound Rules.This loads a ton of already-defined rules. Thankfully, the one we need has already been defined. We just need to turn it on.At the top of this area, click Name to order the list by name (this is not the default).Now, scroll down until you can find the following and double-click it: Core Networking Diagnostics - ICMP Echo Request (ICMPv4-In), Private, Public.Note: There are two of these rules! Look for the one that has Private, Public under the Profile header. The wrong one says Domain.This opens this rule's configuration window, starting on the General tab.In the General tab, look for the following and check the box next to it: EnabledClick Apply, then OK.Back in the main Inbound Rules window, you should see that same rule line now says Yes under the Enabled header.You've enabled ICMP ping! Let's go test it.Switch back to your client1 machine, and run the same ping you ran earlier pointing to srv1. (Refer to Part 2, Step 4.)Does it work?If it does, congratulations! You've just enabled ping for connectivity checking to srv1 and gone through your first foray into the Windows Firewall.  ℹ️ A note for later labs:By default, this rule is set to only allow incoming pings (ICMP requests) from computers on your VM network—that is, other virtual machines on the same VMware NAT or host-only network as your server—not from the wider Internet or any physical computers in the classroom. You can see this by checking the Scope tab in the rule’s properties, where “Remote IP address” is set to “Local subnet.” We’ll spend more time on how Scope and Private/Public profiles affect your firewall rules in our Secondary Network assignment.  📝 Lab Question:Why did we not have to do this for our IIS web server setup? In the Inbound Rules list, scroll through to see if you can find the rule that’s allowing web server pages to be requested from srv1. Write down the name of the rule in your Lab Logbook when you find it (it’s not called IIS) and explain why you think you didn’t have to enable this rule yourself.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Key Concepts​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Lab 4 - Implementing DNS","url":"/OSM620/Labs/lab4#key-concepts","content":" What DNS Does - Domain Name System​  DNS maps names to IP addresses. Humans remember reddit.com. The Internet only understands how to route to 151.101.193.140. It’s hierarchical and distributed, so no single server knows everything. Authoritative servers answer for their zones and resolvers figure the rest out.  Forward vs. Reverse Lookups​  Forward: URL to IP (e.g., srv1.yourSenecaUsername.com converts to 10.0.UID.1) using A/AAAA records.Reverse: IP to URL (e.g., 10.0.UID.1 to srv1.yourSenecaUsername.com) using PTR records in a Reverse Lookup Zone.  Reverse lookup is gold for troubleshooting and clean logs.  Zones and Authority​  A zone is the authoritative dataset for a chunk of namespace. In this lab you create:  Forward zone: yourSenecaUsername.comReverse zone: 10.0.UID.0/24 (IPv4 reverse)  Each zone has an SOA (start of authority) and NS records defining who’s in charge. We keep dynamic updates disabled here for control and repeatability.  Authoritative vs. Recursive (srv1 does both)​  Authoritative: Answers with authority for names inside its zones.Recursive: Chases down answers it doesn’t know yet.  In our setup, srv1 is authoritative for your lab domain and recursive for everything else (via forwarders).  Forwarders vs. Root Hints (and Conditional Forwarders)​  Forwarders: send unknown queries to specific upstream resolvers (what we configure for the classroom).Root hints: the built-in map to the DNS root—slower to “warm up.”Conditional forwarders: send only certain domains to specific DNS servers (handy in enterprises; not needed here).  We will only be using forwarders in this lab for ease of set up.  Records You’ll Actually Touch​  A: Hostname to IPv4.PTR: IPv4 address to hostname (reverse).CNAME (alias): points a name to another name.Rule of thumb: a CNAME can’t live alongside other records at the same name (no A+MX+CNAME pileups).  FQDNs and the DNS Suffix​  Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN): Full path (e.g., srv1.yourname.com.).Short names (e.g., ping srv1) rely on a DNS suffix search list. To keep tests deterministic, we use FQDNs in this lab.  Caching and TTL​  DNS answers are cached to reduce load. The TTL controls how long.  Tips:  After changing records, clear caches where relevant:Client: ipconfig /flushdnsServer: DNS Manager &gt; right-click server &gt; Clear Cache  Ports and Firewall​  DNS uses UDP/53 for most queries, TCP/53 for large responses and zone transfers. With the DNS Server Role installed, inbound DNS rules should be enabled (Private/Public).  Verify. Never assume.  Loopback and Why We Use It on srv1​  The loopback interface (127.0.0.1) sends traffic to the local host. It is immune to network interface card (NIC) misconfigurations. Pointing srv1 at 127.0.0.1 ensures it always asks itself first, which simplifies troubleshooting.  Loop: srv1 &gt; 127.0.0.1 &gt; srv1  Split-Horizon (a.k.a. Split-Brain) DNS (just awareness)​  Enterprises often serve different answers internally VS externally for the same name. In this lab your domain is internal-only. Don’t register it publicly.  Troubleshooting Toolkit  nslookup (classic): Quick forward/reverse tests.Resolve-DnsName (PowerShell): Richer diagnostics (optional).Get-DnsClientServerAddress: Confirm which DNS your client is using.If names resolve but pings fail, think firewall (Lab 3), not DNS.

The Loopback interface's address is always 127.0.0.1 on all systems. (You may sometimes see localhost used for this. That's the URL version of the exact same network interface.)  This special interface is great for a number of reasons, but most importantly: It's completely separate from our other networks and so isn't affected by network configuration mistakes.
