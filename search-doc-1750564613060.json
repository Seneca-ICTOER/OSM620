When security is only considered at the end of a project, it's very difficult to remember all the ways in which your product interacts and things can get missed.  This created several high-profile breaches in the 90s and early 2000s, and our approach to security had to be reconsidered.  As a result, we now consider security from the beginning. As you create applications, add users to databases, create links between services, you must keep security in mind at every step of development. Securing as you go is the best method, but even something as simple as simply documenting unsecured parts of your code as you go can be enough (assuming you go back and fix them!)  Generally, we apply the concept of Principle of Least Privilege to security. Essentially, this boils down to locking everything down as much as possible and only allowing what and who you need through. Open access makes you a target. You'll be applying this principle to the firewall later in this lab.  We also take a look at defaults. Most systems and software come with pre-configured defaults to make out-of-the-box setup easy. This can take the form of a default username and password, default ports, etc. In a well secured system, these are often changed to avoid hack attempts. If you know the default, there's a high chance that hackers know it as well. You'll be changing some defaults in this lab.  This is not an exhaustive list of applied security, but it does give use a bit of working knowledge. You'll need it for this lab as well as in our later work.

Any application, service, or other data that is sent or received by your computer goes through your firewall first. The dominant network protocol is TCP/IP, which means we’re dealing with packets.  A firewall looks at these packets.  To be clear, the firewall doesn’t look inside packets, but just at the outside data like IP address and/or port destination, etc. The actual transmitted data is still secure and unread.  Generally with firewalls, we apply the Principle of Least Privilege by dropping all new connections by default, and allowing a few exceptions. This is known as whitelisting.

Although programmers and developers usually use graphical IDE's to code and compile programs (Visual Studio, Sublime, Eclipse, etc), they can create source code using a text editor and compile their code directly on the server to generate executable programs (without having to transfer them for compilation or execution).  Developers very often use a text editor to modify configuration files. In this course, you will become familiar with the process of installing, configuring, and running network services. Text editors are an important tool to help this setup, but are also used to &quot;tweak&quot; or make periodic changes in service configurations.  The two most readily-available command line text editor built into Windows is Notepad.  However, Notepad is not available in Server Core. To edit a text file in that environment, we have three main options:  Use PowerShell's object-oriented programming to send an edit directly into a text file. This is cumbersome and is not interactive (you don't see the text file on screen), but it is the only built-in option.Transferring the file to a different computer that does have a text editor (like your Windows 11 client), modifying the file there, and transferring it back to your Server Core machine.Using Visual Studio Code to connect remotely the the environment. This is by far the coolest and most convenient option.  We'll be doing all three in this lab to show you how, but going forward, VS Code will be our go-to for interacting with Server Core in most instances. (You will be tested on all three options, so don't skip them!)

It should be noted that the Windows Defender firewall should not be your only defense. Production environments will often have managed networks that restrict access on a larger scale, some of which you will get into with your networking courses.  These work together, though we will only be focusing (mostly) on the Windows firewall in this course.
