# Lab 1.1 - Personal VMware Installation

If you want to use your own laptop (or home desktop) to run your virtual machines for this course, you absolutely can!

Most students will take a mixed approach to this. Use a personal laptop for day-to-day VM work, and then use the classroom's computers for really heavy days.

While the lab work has been written to fit within our classroom time, being able to work on this stuff from home is always a great option.

Let's take a look at what's required to do that!

## Part 1: Computer Hardware Requirements

To run this course and its tech on a personal computer, it must meet the following minimum system requirements:

1. CPU: **6-core Intel/AMD**
1. RAM: **32 GB**
1. Storage: **500 GB SSD free**, *reserved for this course* (if external, USB3.0 or higher)
1. Internet connection: **High speed, stable**

> **CPU architecture is vital.** You *cannot* use ARM or SnapDragon based computers for this course. This includes all Apple Silicon computers (M1/M2/M3/M4, etc).

## Part 2: Registering Your Broadcom Account

Broadcom (formerly VMware) now requires account registration before you can download the VMware Workstation software. Follow the instructions below to do so. You only have to do this once. (If you already have an account using your Seneca e-mail, skip to Part 3.)

1. Visit the Broadcom registration site: profile.broadcom.com/web/registration
1. Provide your Seneca e-mail address and continue.
1. You will be sent a verification code. Check your Seneca e-mail and enter the code on the page.
1. On the *Complete your Registration* page, enter your information and click **Create Account.**
1. On the *Registered Successfully!* page, you can skip the rest and simply click **I'll do it later**.
1. At the top right of the screen, click on the **Login** button. (No, you aren't logged in automatically. Yes, it's annoying.)
1. Enter your Seneca e-mail address as your username and the password you chose on Part 4 as your credentials.
1. When complete, you should see your name in the top right of the screen instead of *Login.* If not, attempt to log in again or ask for help.

## Part 3: Downloading VMware Workstation

1. Go to this link: [Download VMware Workstation](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=VMware%20Workstation%20Pro&freeDownloads=true)
1. Click on **VMware Workstation Pro 17 for Windows**
1. Click on the highest version available. (17.6.3 as of last update)
1. On the next screen, click on the blue link inside *I agree to the Terms and Conditions* to open a new tab with their terms and conditions. Do not close this window.
1. Back in the previous window/tab that's still open, now click the checkbox for *I agree to the Terms and Conditions*.
1. Click on the little cloud icon next to the name of the download file.
1. Click the **Yes** button when the dialog box pops up.
1. In the *Trade Compliance and Download Conditions* screen, fill in the following school information:
    1. Address1: **1750 Finch Ave E**
    1. City: **North York**
    1. State/Province: **Ontario**
    1. Country: **Canada**
    1. Zip/Postal Code: **M2J 2X5**
1. ***Finally*** click on the cloud icon again to begin the actual download.
1. If you ever need to download the software again, you won't have to go through any of the registration mess. Follow Part 3, Steps 1-3, then Part 9.

## Part 4: Install VMware Workstation

1. Find the downloaded .exe file and run the installer.
1. Follow all prompts and install.

## Part 5: Launch VMware Workstation

1. Open **VMware Workstation** from your desktop or the Start Menu.
1. When asked, paste in your serial key.
1. Proceed to the next Investigation.
