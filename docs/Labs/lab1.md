# Lab 1 - Environment Setup

## Lab Preparations

### Purpose of Lab 1

In this lab you will stand up the base environment you’ll use for the course. You’ll obtain official installation media and keys, prepare VMware Workstation, and deploy two servers:

* srv1:  Windows Server 2025 Datacenter, GUI (Desktop Experience)
* srv2: Windows Server 2025 Datacenter, CLI (Core)

You’ll complete essential post-install tasks (time zone, naming, activation, updates), then place both servers on a two-NIC layout so they can talk to each other on a private subnet while still reaching the internet for updates.

By the end, the machines are clean, consistent, and ready for later labs (security hardening, DNS, DHCP, and eventually AD).

### Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

* Acquire **Windows Server 2025 Datacenter** installation media and your individual product key from Azure Education and store them securely.
* Access **VMware Workstation** on a Seneca lab PC (locally or via MyApps) or install it on a personal PC.
* Provision two VMs with the required specs and networks:
  * srv1-`senecausername` (GUI) with NAT + VMnet10 NICs.
  * srv2-`senecausername` (Core) with NAT + VMnet10 NICs.
* Complete essential post-install tasks on each server.
* Configure NIC2 on each server for the internal lab subnet 10.0.`UID`.0/24:
  * srv1 → 10.0.`UID`.1/24
  * srv2 → 10.0.`UID`.2/24
* Verify basic Internet connectivity prerequisites for later labs within each VM.

### Minimium Requirements

Before beginning, you must have:

1. Attended the Week 1 lecture.
2. Read through the Week 1 slides, and have them handy as a reference for concepts.
1. Working access to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) with your Seneca credentials.
1. Access to VMware Workstation (Seneca lab PC or personal PC meeting course specs).
1. Your external SSD with at least 250 GB of dedicated space for this course.
1. Your assigned **UID** (from Blackboard Grades) handy for addressing.
1. Your physically printed **OSM620 Lab Logbook** for notetaking and saving commands.
1. Optional, but recommended: Caffeine delivery system.

## Investigation 1: Downloading Installation Media

In this investigation, you will be downloading your Windows OS installation media by logging into your Seneca-based Azure account. You will also generate your personal serial keys.

1. Navigate to the Microsoft Azure site: [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
1. Use your Seneca e-mail address and password to login.
1. Once on the main Azure page, look for the Search bar at the top of the page.
1. In the Search bar, type: **Education**, then hit Enter.
1. In the **Education | Overview** page, look to the left. You will see menu items already displayed on screen. (*Overview*, *Learning resources*, etc.)
1. Inside **Learning resources** in the left menu, click on **Software**.
1. In the main **Software** page, there is a Search bar just below the word Software (it says *Search* inside it.)
1. In that search field, type and enter: **Windows Server 2025 Datacenter**
1. In the item that appears below (there should only be one), click the link for **Windows Server 2025 Datacenter**.
1. On the right, an information box appears describing the software. Using your mouse to hover over this information box, scroll down to the bottom.
1. You should now see two items: **View Key** and **Download**
1. Click on **Download** first to begin downloading the Server 2025 ISO. You will need this for your operating system installation. (Don't forget where you've saved it!)
1. While the ISO file is downloading, click on **View Key**.
1. Copy this key into a text file that you save locally on your personal computer or personal USB key. You will need this for the Server installation and for any reinstalls later in the semester. **Do not lose this key and do NOT share it with anyone!**
1. Repeat steps 8-14 for the **Windows 11 Education** ISO and serial key. You will need that for later.

## Investigation 2: Using VMware Workstation

The use of *VMware Workstation* is required for this course. You can either use a Seneca Lab computer (Option 1a / Option 1b) or a personal computer (Option 2).

If you use an external SSD, you can use both!

> **WARNING:** Seneca Lab computers erase any locally saved data when restarted from their internal drives. Save all work to an external drive or online storage.

### Option 1a: Seneca Lab Computers w/VMware Workstation Installed Locally

How do you know if your particular Seneca Lab classroom has VMware Workstation installed?

**When you log in, the VMware Workstation icon will be visible on the desktop.** If it is not, jump to *Option 1b*.

1. Log in to the Seneca workstation with your Seneca username (don't include @myseneca.ca) and password.
1. Once the desktop has fully loaded, double-click on the **VMware Workstation** icon on the desktop. (If not present, jump to *Option 1b* instructions.)
1. When the **VMware Workstation** application appears on screen, continue to the next Investigation.

### Option 1b: Seneca Lab Computers *without* VMware Workstation Installed

**Do not use this option if your lab computer already has *VMware Workstation* installed. Go back to *Option 1a*.**

1. Log in to the Seneca workstation with your Seneca username (don't include @myseneca.ca) and password.
1. Once the desktop has fully loaded, double-click on the **Seneca MyApps** icon on the desktop.
1. In the browser that launches, log in with your Seneca credentials.
1. Do not ignore dialog boxes! Read them carefully instead of just clicking *Cancel* or randomly.
1. In the search bar in the middle of the screen, type *VMware* and hit **Enter.**
1. One result should show up, **VMware WS Pro**. Click this result.
1. In the new *VMware WS Pro* page, click on the version number (Example: 17.6.1). This will launch the application over the network.
1. Click on allow for any dialog boxes that appear. Remember, **do not ignore dialog boxes!**
1. Be patient. It can take a bit for the background files to transfer over the network.
1. When complete, the **VMware Workstation** application should appear on screen. (You will also see the **VMware Workstation** icon on the desktop. You can launch it from here if you accidentally close the program.)
1. Proceed to the next investigation.

### Option 2: Personal Computer

#### Part 1: Computer Hardware Requirements

To run this course and its tech on a personal computer, it must meet the following minimum system requirements:

1. CPU: **6-core Intel/AMD**
1. RAM: **32 GB**
1. Storage: **250 GB SSD free**, *reserved for this course* (if external, USB3.0 or higher)
1. Internet connection: **High speed, stable**

> **CPU architecture is vital.** You *cannot* use ARM or SnapDragon based computers for this course. This includes all Apple Silicon computers (M1/M2/M3/M4, etc).

#### Part 2: Registering Your Broadcom Account

Broadcom (formerly VMware) now requires account registration before you can download the VMware Workstation software. Follow the instructions below to do so. You only have to do this once. (If you already have an account using your Seneca e-mail, skip to Part 3.)

1. Visit the Broadcom registration site: profile.broadcom.com/web/registration
1. Provide your Seneca e-mail address and continue.
1. You will be sent a verification code. Check your Seneca e-mail and enter the code on the page.
1. On the *Complete your Registration* page, enter your information and click **Create Account.**
1. On the *Registered Successfully!* page, you can skip the rest and simply click **I'll do it later**.
1. At the top right of the screen, click on the **Login** button. (No, you aren't logged in automatically. Yes, it's annoying.)
1. Enter your Seneca e-mail address as your username and the password you chose on Part 4 as your credentials.
1. When complete, you should see your name in the top right of the screen instead of *Login.* If not, attempt to log in again or ask for help.

### Part 3: Downloading VMware Workstation

1. Go to this link: [Download VMware Workstation](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=VMware%20Workstation%20Pro&freeDownloads=true)

1. ***Finally*** click on the cloud icon again to begin the actual download.
1. If you ever need to download the software again, you won't have to go through any of the registration mess. Follow Part 3, Steps 1-3, then Part 9.

### Part 4: Install VMware Workstation

1. Find the downloaded .exe file and run the installer.
1. Follow all prompts and install.

### Part 5: Launch VMware Workstation

1. Open **VMware Workstation** from your desktop or the Start Menu.
1. When asked, paste in your serial key.
1. Proceed to the next Investigation.

## Investigation 3: VM1 Installation - Windows Server 2025 Datacenter (*srv1*)

* Hypervisor: **VMware Workstation**
* Name: **srv1-cjohnson30**
* RAM: **16 GB**
* CPU: **6 cores**

        1. ***Do not select "Log on automatically"***.
        1. Click **Next**.
1. On the "Name the Virtual Machine" screen, do the following:
    1. Virtual machine name: **srv1-*senecausername***
       > **Explanation:** For example, if my Seneca e-mail address is `cjohnson30@myseneca.ca`, then my Seneca username is *cjohnson30*. This would give me a VM name of *srv1-cjohnson30*.
    1. Location: If using an external SSD (like with our lab computers), click **Browse** and navigate to your external SSD.
        1. Create the following directory structure in your SSD: *OSM620 > Virtual Machines/srv1-cjohnson30*
        1. Select this new *srv1-cjohnson30* folder.
        1. Make sure you now see this change in the Location field.

    >
    > Feel free to get some caffeine or make a sandwich.

1. Eventually, you will be presented with the desktop and the VMware Tools installer having completed and asking if you'd like to restart. Choose **Yes**.
1. Once you've restarted, your installation is complete.

## Investigation 4: Post-Installation Tasks (*srv1*)

After installing a new operating system, there are always a number of **post-installation tasks** to complete. **These aren't optional!**

### Part 1: Applying Time Zone Settings

This one is fairly straight-forward. Having the proper time zone set (EST) is essential for proper time keeping and ensuring encrypted webpages connect properly.

1. In the *Server Manager* application, click on **Local Server** in the left-hand menubar.
1. In the main *Properties* area, on the right-hand column, look for the *Time Zone* line. It should say **(UTC-05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada)**.
1. If the *Time Zone* line item doesn't say the above, click on the displayed time zone and change it to UTC-05:00 as seen above.

### Part 2: Server Name Change

The default name applied to your new server will be semi-randomized. For proper identification (and to not wonder which server you're on when you have several), we're going to change this.

1. In the *Server Manager* application, click on **Local Server** in the left-hand menubar.
1. In the main *Properties* area, on the left-hand column, look for the *Computer name* line.
1. Click the current computer name.
1. In the *System Properties* dialog box that pops up, find the **Change** button and click it. (Ignore the *Computer Description* field. It's tempting, but wrong!)
1. In the new *Computer Name/Domain Changes* dialog box that pops up, find the *Computer name* field. Replace it with **srv1-SenecaUsername**.
1. When you click **OK**, the system will warn you about restarting. Choose to restart the system when asked.
1. Once you've restarted and logged back in, go back to the *Server Manager* from Part 1 and double-check your new computer name is correct. **Do not skip this step!**
1. If it is, you're done!

### Part 3: Windows Activation

Activating Windows unlocks certain settings and features. Since you've used your valid serial key (right?), you can activate with Microsoft easily.

1. In the *Server Manager* application, click on **Local Server** in the left-hand menubar.
1. In the main *Properties* area, on the right-hand column, look for the *Product ID* line.
1. Click on the **Not activated** link.
1. Follow the instructions in the popup dialog box. If unable to activate easily, **ask your professor for help**.

### Part 4: Installing OS Updates

A critical part of a security-conscious mindset is running regular updates. **This is NOT something you do only once at the start of installation.** You should be running these regularly to keep up to date with security fixes and zero-day exploits.

1. If you're already in the *Settings* application, look through the left menubar for **Windows Update** and click it. (Otherwise, click on the *Start* menu and search for **Updates**.)
1. In the *Windows Update* main screen, scroll down to **Advanced Options** and click it.
1. The very first option is *Receive updates to other Microsoft products*. Toggle this from **Off** to **On**.
1. At the top of the screen, where it says *Windows Update > Advanced Options*, click **Windows Update** to go back to the previous screen.
1. You will likely already see updates ready. Click on **Download & install all**.
1. As you might expect, this can take a while. Timing will depend on your Internet connection, how fast your computer is, how fast your SSD is, and how many updates there are. Please be patient. Your computer may restart.
1. Once updates have begun, take a break while it does its thing. Grab a drink, make a sandwich, text a friend.
1. After updates are complete, go back into *Windows Update* and click **Check for updates** again. There may be (and often times are) more.
1. If there are more updates, complete Steps 5-8 again until there are no more updates available.
1. In *Windows Update*, scroll back down to **Advanced options** again and click it.
1. Inside *Windows Update > Advanced options* scroll down to **Optional updates** and click it.
1. Select all available updates that appear (you may have to expand some lists).
1. Click **Download & install**.

### Part 5: Configuring Network Interface Card 2 (NIC2)

We have two network interfaces on this virtual machine. NIC1 is set to DHCP and is our Internet connection. We don't touch that one. It's configuration is automatic.

**However, NIC2 requires manual configuration.** Why do we need NIC2? It's what we'll be using to communicate with *srv2* and our other VMs.

1. In the *Server Manager* application, click on **Local Server** in the left-hand menubar.
1. In the main *Properties* area, on the left-hand column, look for the *Ethernet1* line.
1. Click on the **IPv4 address assigned by DHCP** link.
1. In the *Network Connections* window that pops up, right-click on the *Ethernet1* icon.
1. Click *Rename* from the drop-down, and rename the adapter to: **Internal Network**
1. If that doesn't work, select the *Ethernet1* icon and hit **F2** on your keyboard to rename as above.
1. Right-click on the renamed *Internal Network* icon, and select *Properties* from the drop-down menu.
1. In the new *Internal Network Properties* dialog box, find the *Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)* entry and uncheck it.
1. Now, look for the *Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)* entry, select it (do not uncheck), and look for the **Properties** button just below and click it.
1. In the new *Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties* dialog box, select the *Use the following IP address:* radio button.
1. In the fields directly below, enter the following:
    1. IP address: **10.0.*UID*.1**

          > *UID* is a placeholder. In Blackboard in Grades, there is a UID column. Each student has been assigned a unique ID number for this course. You will use that number in the address above.
          >
          > For example, if my UID on Blackboard is *40*, then my address in the step above is **10.0.40.1**. (Yours will be different!)

    1. Subnet mask: **255.255.255.0**
    1. Leave all other fields blank.
    1. Click **OK**.
    1. Back in the *Internal Network Properties* dialog box, click **Close**.
    1. Switch back to the *Server Manager > Local Server* application, and hit the *Refresh* icon. (It's the icon that looks like a music shuffle symbol to the left of the flag icon at the top right.)
    1. You should now see: **Internal Network 10.0.*UID*.1**
    1. Go back to the *Network Connections* window, and find the other adapter icon. (Likely called *Ethernet0*)
    1. Rename this to: **External Network**
    1. Go back to *Server Manager > Local Server*, refresh, and confirm you can see the new *External Network* name.
    1. If you do, you're done!

### Part 6: Internet Connectivity Check w/Edge

We'll double-check we can access the Internet using the built-in Microsoft Edge application.

1. Open *Microsoft Edge*.
1. Go through the first-run questions.
1. When able, use the browser to navigate to **eff.org**.
1. If the website loads, move on to the next step. If not, **ask your professor for help**.

### Part 7: Download and Install Firefox

There are a ton of feature and privacy reasons *not* to use Microsoft Edge. Instead, we'll download and install **Mozilla Firefox** and use that going forward.

1. Open *Microsoft Edge*.
1. Navigate to: [Download Mozilla Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/en-CA/browsers/desktop/windows)
1. Wait for the installer to finish, then open it.
1. Follow the installer instructions.
1. Once complete, open *Firefox* and navigate to **eff.org** to check everything is okay.
1. Close *Microsoft Edge* forever.

## Investigation 5: VM2 Installation - Windows Server 2025 Core (*srv2*)

## Investigation 6: Post-Installation Tasks (*srv2*)

After installing a new operating system, there are always a number of **post-installation tasks** to complete. **These aren't optional!**

### Part 1: Applying Time Zone Settings

This one is fairly straight-forward. Having the proper time zone set (EST) is essential for proper time keeping and ensuring encrypted webpages connect properly.

1. In the *SConfig* application, select Option 9 (*Date and Time*). Use your keyboard.
1. The *Date and Time* dialog box pops up.
1. Look for the *Time Zone* line. It should say **(UTC-05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada)**.
1. If the *Time Zone* line item doesn't say the above, click on the *Change time zone...* button and change it to UTC-05:00 as seen above.
1. Click **OK** to close out of *Date and Time*.
1. Back in *SConfig*, choose Option 9 again to confirm your changes have stuck. If yes, continue to Part 2.

### Part 2: Server Name Change

The default name applied to your new server will be semi-randomized. For proper identification (and to not wonder which server you're on when you have several), we're going to change this.

1. In the *SConfig* application, selection Option 2 (*Computer name*). Use your keyboard.
1. In the new *Computer name* screen, enter your new computer name in the waiting text field: **srv2-SenecaUsername**
1. Press **Enter** on your keyboard to confirm the change.
1. The system now asks you about restarting. Enter **Y** to choose yes and hit the **Enter** key to confirm.
1. Once you've restarted and logged back in, go back to the *Computer name* screen from Part 2 and double-check your new computer name is correct. **Do not skip this step!**
1. If it is, you're done!

### Part 3: Windows Activation

Activating Windows unlocks certain settings and features. Since you've used your valid serial key (right?), you can activate with Microsoft easily.

1. In the *SConfig* application, select Option 11 (*Windows activation*). Use your keyboard.
1. In the new *Windows activation* screen, enter **2** (*Activate Windows*) and hit **Enter** to begin the activation process with Microsoft.
1. Follow the instructions on screen. If unable to activate easily, **ask your professor for help**.

### Part 4: Installing OS Updates

A critical part of a security-conscious mindset is running regular updates. **This is NOT something you do only once at the start of installation.** You should be running these regularly to keep up to date with security fixes and zero-day exploits.

1. In the *SConfig* application, select Option 5 (*Update settings*). Use your keyboard.
1. In the new *Update setting* screen, enter **5** (*Opt-in to Microsoft Update*) and hit **Enter** to confirm.
1. The next screen will ask you confirm again. Enter **y** and hit **Enter** to continue. (Then, hit **Enter** again.)
1. In the *SConfig* application, select Option 6 (*Install updates*). Use your keyboard.
1. In the new *Install updates* screen, enter **1** (*All quality updates*) and hit **Enter** to confirm.
1. After a short check, you are asked which updates to install. Select **a** to install all updates and hit **Enter** to confirm.
1. As you might expect, this can take a while. Timing will depend on your Internet connection, how fast your computer is, how fast your SSD is, and how many updates there are. Please be patient.
1. Once updates have begun, take a break while it does its thing. Grab a drink, make a sandwich, text a friend.
1. If asked to restart, choose **yes**.
1. After updates are complete, go through Steps 4-6 again. Do so until the system tells you there are no new updates. (It may take a few cycles to get them all.)
1. When complete, shut down *srv2*. Use the on-screen menu options in *SConfig* to do so.

### Part 5: Configuring Network Interface Card 2 (NIC2)

We have two network interfaces on this virtual machine. NIC1 is set to DHCP and is our Internet connection. We don't touch that one. It's configuration is automatic.

**However, NIC2 requires manual configuration.** Why do we need NIC2? It's what we'll be using to communicate with *srv1* and our other VMs.

1. In the *SConfig* application, select Option 8 (*Network Settings*).
1. In the *Network settings* screen, look for the unconfigured network adapter. It's likely the second one, and will likely have an address starting with **169.** If you aren't sure, ask your professor for help.
1. Select that adapter using the menu option and your keyboard, and hit **Enter** to confirm.
1. In the *Network adapter settings* screen, select Option 4 (*Rename network adapter*).
1. Enter the new network adapter name in the field: **Internal Network**
1. Hit **Enter** twice to confirm.
1. When the *Network adapter settings* screen refreshes, you should see the new name. If not, repeat Steps 4-6 again, or ask for help from your professor.
1. Now, select Option 1 (*Set network adapter address*).
1. Select **S** for *Static IP address*.
1. Enter your new IP address for this machine. It will take the following form: **10.0.*UID*.2**

    > *UID* is a placeholder. In Blackboard in Grades, there is a UID column. Each student has been assigned a unique ID number for this course. You will use that number in the address above.
    >
    > For example, if my UID on Blackboard is *40*, then my address in the step above is **10.0.40.2**. (Yours will be different!)

1. In the *Enter subnet mask* field, stick with the default by keeping the field blank and hitting **Enter**.
1. In the *Enter default gateway* field, use: **10.0.*UID*.1**
1. Hit **Enter** once the configuration has completed.
1. Back in the *Network adapter settings* screen, confirm your changes from above. You should see them all displayed. If not, repeat the missing steps or as your professor for help.
1. If everything looks good, hit **Enter** to go back to the main menu screen.
1. Go back into *Network settings* and change the other network adapter's name to: **External Network**
1. Make no other changes to this adapter.
1. You're done!
